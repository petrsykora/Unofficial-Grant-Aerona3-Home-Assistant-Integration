A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for **Grant Aerona3 Heat Pumps** using Modbus TCP communication. This integration automatically discovers and creates entities for all available registers, providing complete monitoring and control of your heat pump system.

## ✨ Features

- **🔧 Simple Setup**: Just enter IP address, port, and scan interval - no complex configuration
- **📊 Complete Monitoring**: All 150+ Modbus registers automatically created as entities
- **🌡️ Accurate COP Calculation**: Configure your flow rate for precise efficiency measurements
- **🏠 Zone Control**: Climate entities for heating zones with temperature control
- **⚙️ Full Control**: Switches for weather compensation, frost protection, and system settings
- **🔢 Setpoint Management**: Number entities for all temperature and timing settings
- **📈 Real-time Data**: Temperature sensors, power consumption, compressor frequency, and more
- **🚨 System Monitoring**: Error detection, defrost mode, and system health indicators

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** the integration (see [Installation Guide](Docs/installation_guide.md))
2. **Add Integration** via Home Assistant UI
3. **Enter Details**: IP address (required), port (502), slave ID (1), scan interval (30s)
