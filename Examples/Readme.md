To use copy the wc-plotter file and place it in the www folder of your Home Assistant instance. then create a button on the dashboard of your choice and just click the button.
Enter your design temps and if you like the current OAT. Then use the sliders to adjust your test curve. I have found using the full range of your ashp works well then adjust it left and right using the OAT max and min values.
